# About Me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/).  Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, advised by Prof. [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/).

My interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and distributed systems. I try to find insights from different domains and use them to improve the performance (accuracy, efficiency, interpretability) of current machine learning models.
