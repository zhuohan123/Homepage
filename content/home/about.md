# About Me

I am an incoming PhD student at UC Berkeley. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, advised by Prof. [Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/).

My research interest is machine learning in general. I try to find insights from different domains and use them to improve the performance (accuracy, efficiency, interpretability) of current machine learning models.
